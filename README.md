## About me:
* I code mainly in Python whilst having considerable knowledge of C++. PyCharm is the IDE I use nearly all the time.
* I like making GUI applications, which is what most of my repositories contain. I'm interested in game development too.
* I plan to open myself up to various other languages and game engines, albeit I'm also being plagued with responsibilities.
* Aside from proramming and computer science in general, I like mathematics, physics and history as well.
* I'm an introverted person who mostly prefers to spend time alone or with certain groups.

Feel free to browse around this profile. I'm not an expert in anything - I just do things out of personal interest and other motivations while trying to get better.
